# Spec-Driven Development

## Philosophy

The spec is not documentation — it is the contract between what the business needs and what the code does.
Every task in the spec must be **deliverable, testable, and independent**.
The model does not improvise: it writes no line of code that is not in the spec.

---

## Workflow

```
1. Write the spec  (create Feature ticket + actors → use cases → stages → tasks)
2. Graphify context (auto-updated on every commit; query before touching a module)
3. UI? → mockup    (if the spec touches UI)
4. TDD loop        (per task: red → green → commit → graphify auto-updates)
5. Brain update    (/save — metrics generated automatically)
6. PR             (git push-pr)
```

Graphify updates itself automatically after every `git commit` (post-commit hook installed by bootstrap). Metrics are generated automatically by `/save`. **The user's only manual steps are: write estimates (`Human: Xh`), commit code, and say `/save`.**

---

## Step 1: Create the Feature ticket + Spec

### 1a — Create the Feature ticket in the brain

Before writing the spec, create a ticket in `brain/Features/<feature-name>.md`. This is the persistent record — it lives in the vault and tracks status across sessions.

```markdown
---
title: <Feature Name>
tags: [feature, <topic>]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft
type: feature
spec: docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md
branch: feature/<name>
layers_committed: []
---

# <Feature Name>

## Summary

<One paragraph: what this does and why it matters.>

## Actors

- **<Actor>** — <role>

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] <criterion derived from use cases>

## Tasks

_Populated from the spec stages — copy stage/task list here after writing the spec._

## Decisions

_Wikilinks to ADRs in [[Decisions/]] created during this feature._

## Related

_Wikilinks to [[Architecture/]], [[Codebase/]], [[Database/]] notes this feature touches._
```

After creating the ticket, update `brain/Features/index.md` to add a wikilink to it.

`layers_committed:` tracks which of the `driver` skill's 5 layers (spec/api/app/qa/stats) already has its one commit landed — it's how a resumed session tells "task ticked" apart from "layer actually committed" after a session cuts mid-feature. Only the `driver` skill writes to it; ignore it when running a layer's skill standalone.

### 1b — Write the Spec

Save to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md`. Copy the task list into the Feature ticket once the stages are defined.

```markdown
# Spec: <feature name>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Branch:** feature/<name>
**Stack:** rails | react | python | (all)
**Ticket:** brain/Features/<feature-name>.md

---

## Actors

| Actor | Role |
|-------|------|
| Registered user | Who initiates the action |
| External system | Third-party API being consumed |
| Admin | Who approves or configures |

---

## Use Cases

### UC-01: <Use case name>
- **Actor:** Registered user
- **Precondition:** The user has an active account
- **Main flow:**
  1. The user does X
  2. The system validates Y
  3. The system executes Z
  4. The user sees the result
- **Alternative flows:**
  - 2a. Y is not valid → show error E
- **Postcondition:** The system records W

### UC-02: ...

---

## Stages and Tasks

Each stage is a set of deliverable tasks. Each task = 1 PR.

### Stage 1: <name> (minimum viable)

- [ ] **T1.1** — <one-line description> | Stack: rails | Size: S/M/L | Human: Xh
- [ ] **T1.2** — <one-line description> | Stack: react | Size: S/M/L | Human: Xh

### Stage 2: <name> (complete the flow)

- [ ] **T2.1** — ... | Stack: ... | Size: M | Human: 3h

### Stage 3: <name> (edge cases + observability)

- [ ] **T3.1** — ... | Stack: ... | Size: S | Human: 1h

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] UC-01 works end-to-end in staging
- [ ] Tests cover the main flow + alternative flows for each UC
- [ ] No regressions in the existing suite
- [ ] Metrics within range (see Step 5)

---

## Design Decisions

_Record non-obvious decisions made during the spec here._
```

---

## Step 2: Graphify Context

The graph is always up to date — bootstrap installed a post-commit hook that runs `graphify-update` after every commit automatically.

Before touching an existing module, query the graph:

```bash
graphify query "<feature topic>"
graphify explain "<MostRelevantModule>"
```

Record in the spec (Design Decisions section) which existing modules will be extended.

---

## Step 3: UI — Mockup (only if applicable)

**Trigger:** the spec mentions UI, form, modal, screen, panel, or visual list.

1. Invoke skill `frontend-design`
2. Save HTML to `docs/designs/<branch>/<feature>.html`
3. Screenshot with `claude-in-chrome` → save PNG
4. Commit: `git commit -m "design: mockup <feature>"`

---

## Step 4: TDD Loop

### Parallelization decision

Before starting implementation, check task independence for the current stage:

```
Are there 2+ tasks in this stage targeting DIFFERENT stacks?
  YES → launch parallel agents (one per task)
  NO  → run sequentially in this session
```

Tasks are independent when:
- They target different stacks (rails ≠ react ≠ python)
- Neither task's output is an input to the other
- They don't touch the same files

### Parallel execution (different stacks)

For each independent task, spawn a fresh agent with its own worktree:

```
Agent per task:
  - subagent_type: "fresh"
  - isolation: "worktree"
  - model: "sonnet"
  - prompt: |
      Implement [T1.x]: <one-line description>
      Branch: feature/<feature>
      Stack: <rails|react|python>

      Steps:
      1. Load skill <stack>
      2. Load skill tdd-loop
      3. Run the full tdd-loop for this task
      4. Commit: feat(T1.x): <description>
      5. Mark task [x] in docs/superpowers/specs/<spec-file> AND in brain/Features/<feature>.md
      6. Log: scripts/metric-logger.sh task T1.x green <human_hours>   # e.g. 4h from the task's Human: field
```

Wait for all parallel agents to finish before starting the next stage.

### Sequential execution (same stack or dependent)

1. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/<feature>-T1.1`
2. Load the corresponding stack skill (`rails`, `react`, `python`)
3. Run the TDD loop skill (`tdd-loop`)
4. On green: `git commit -m "feat(T1.1): <description>"`
5. Mark the task as `[x]` in the spec AND in `brain/Features/<feature>.md`
6. Log: `scripts/metric-logger.sh task T1.1 green 4h`   # replace 4h with the task's Human: estimate
7. Repeat for T1.2, T2.1, …

**Rule:** do not start T1.2 until T1.1 is green and committed.

### Model routing

| Task type | Model | Effort | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Spec + graphify context | Opus or fork | high | Needs full business context, ambiguity to resolve |
| TDD red→green | Sonnet | medium | Fast iteration, scope already pinned by the spec |
| Refactor | Sonnet | medium | Mechanical, low ambiguity |
| Code review | Sonnet | high | Multi-file reasoning, worth catching subtle issues |
| Graphify queries only | Haiku | low | Read-only lookups |

---

## Step 5: Metrics

**Automatic — no manual steps needed.**

`/save` generates session metrics and saves them to `brain/Metrics/` automatically. If this session shipped a feature, `/save` also generates the AI vs human comparison.

The only thing to fill in manually is `Human: Xh` on each task — this is the estimate that powers the comparison. It takes 5 seconds per task and is the only input the automation can't derive on its own.

Alerts to watch for (Claude will flag these during the session):
- `ai_blob_score > 20` — functions over 40 lines without tests
- `spec_drift` — code outside the spec's scope

---

## Step 6: Brain Update (`/save`)

Tell Claude `/save` — it handles everything automatically:
- Updates `brain/Features/<feature>.md` (status, ticked tasks, wikilinks)
- Updates relevant domain folders (Architecture, Codebase, Database, etc.)
- Generates session metrics → `brain/Metrics/session-YYYY-MM-DD-<branch>.md`
- If the feature is shipped: generates AI vs human comparison → `brain/Metrics/<feature>-comparison.md`
- `git commit`

Domain folders updated per what changed:

| What changed | Brain folder |
|--------------|-------------|
| New service or data flow | `brain/Architecture/` |
| New module or pattern | `brain/Codebase/` |
| Schema or migration | `brain/Database/` |
| New external integration | `brain/APIs/` |
| Non-obvious tech decision | `brain/Decisions/` (ADR) |
| Setup changed | `brain/Install/` |
| Infra or CI changed | `brain/Infra/` |

Each note in `brain/Decisions/` follows this format:
```markdown
# ADR-NN: <title>

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** accepted | superseded | deprecated

## Context
What situation forced this decision.

## Decision
What we decided.

## Consequences
What becomes easier or harder as a result.
```

Use skill `obsidian-integration` to read/write vault notes.

---

## Step 7: PR

```bash
git push-pr
```

Pushes the branch and opens one PR for the whole feature. The body includes:
- Commit summary
- Token consumption drift vs the session baseline
- Graphify and brain (Obsidian) request counts
- Spec drift — files touched outside the plan
- Test coverage delta — new files without a matching test
- Mockup screenshots (if any)
